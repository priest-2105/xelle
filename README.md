## The motivation:
A new report published by UNICEF and WaterAid found that more than a third of girls in South Asia miss school during their periods, mainly due to a lack of access to toilets and pads in schools and no proper education about menstruation. The UN has recognized menstrual hygiene as a global public health and human rights issue, globally 1.2 billion women lack access to basic sanitation and hygiene. So we decided to end the Period-Poverty and long-run stigma by educating girls and providing healthcare facilities to them.
